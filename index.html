			<h4> About me </h4>
			<p>I have just completed my jounior year of education at Bowling Green State University in computer science.
			I am looking for an internship, and later a potential career in web development, database management or a COBOL position.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Previous employement </h4>
			<p>I have worked the past three years and am starting my fourth as seasonal work at Giant Eagle, a grocery store chain.
			I worked in the prepared foods department making subs to order and attending the gourmet foods counter as well.
			I have also worked in the meat department as a counter worker.  This allows me to directly work with customers to satisfy their requests.
			Working at Giant Eagle has greatly enhanced and improved my ability to work with customers as well as work with coworkers to achieve a desired outcome.
