				<h4>Languages </h4>
					<p>I have learned multiple languages over my years attending BGSU.
						<ul>
							<li>Java</li>
							<li>C++</li>
							<li>COBOL</li>
							<li>mysql</li>
							<li>html</li>
							<li>css</li>
							<li>php</li>
						</ul>
					I learned Java in high school and at BGSU.  This was my first exposure to coding and where I found a passion for it.  
					C++ is the main language taught at BGSU as well as the first one you learn.
					COBOL was an elective I choice to take to one; see how far we have come from this old language and two, to be familiar with it if my career would lead me there.
					Mysql I learned in a Java class as well as a database course that we used mysql for majority of the time.  
					I learned html with css and php in a web development course I took.</p>
